# Maze-Solver
Data Structures and Algorithm project 1
These three files contain a stack implementation using am array as the base. A queue implementation using a linked list 
and finally Maze which is used to solve a map using both the data structures. 

Concepts included:
1. Breadth- first transversal
2. Depth-first transversal
3. Stack and Queue funcionality
4. Using two dimensional arrays.
5. String manipulation
